# Graduate_Admissions

In these notebooks, we will take a dataset from Kaggle on chances of admission to graduate programs. The data contains the following information:

Serial No.: A way to keep track of entries, goes from 1 to the length of the dataset
GRE Score: What the score the applicant recieved from the GRE
TOEFL Score: What score the applicant recieved from the TOEFL
University Rating: On a scale of 5 how prestigous the University is that the applicant is applying to
SOP: The length of the statement of purpose on a scale of 5
LOR: The strength of the letters of recommendation
CGPA: The undergradate GPA of the applicant on a scale of 10
Research: Whether the applicant has research experience. 1 if yes, 0 if no
Chance of Admit: The chance they will be admitted to that graduate program

We will measure accuracy using the mean squared error and the R-squared value.
